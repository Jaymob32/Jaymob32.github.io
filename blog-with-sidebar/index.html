                    Tarot (/ˈtæroʊ/, first known as trionfi and later as 
                    tarocchi or tarocks) is a pack of playing cards, used 
                    from at least the mid-15th century in various parts of 
                    Europe to play card games such as Tarocchini. From their 
                    Italian roots, tarot-playing cards spread to most of 
                    Europe, evolving into a family of games that includes 
                    German Grosstarok and modern games such as French Tarot 
                    and Austrian Königrufen. In the late 18th century French 
                    occultists made elaborate, but unsubstantiated, claims 
                    about their history and meaning, leading to the 
                    emergence of custom decks for use in divination via 
                    tarot card reading and cartomancy.

                <p>
                    Thus, there are two 
                    distinct types of tarot packs in circulation: those used 
                    for card games and those used for divination. However, 
                    some older patterns, such as the Tarot de Marseille, 
                    originally intended for playing card games, are also 
                    used for cartomancy.

                <p>
                    Tarot cards, then known as tarocchi, first appeared in 
                    Ferrara and Milan in northern Italy, with the Fool and 21 
                    trumps (then called trionfi) being added to the standard 
                    Italian pack of four suits: batons, coins, cups and swords. 
                    Scholarship has established that the early European cards 
                    were probably based on the Egyptian Mamluk deck invented in 
                    or before the 14th century, which followed the introduction 
                    of paper from Asia into Western Europe. By the late 
                    1300s, Europeans were producing their own cards, the 
                    earliest patterns being based on the Mamluk deck but with 
                    variations to the suit symbols and court cards.
                    The first records of playing cards in Europe date to 1367 in 
                    Bern and they appear to have spread very rapidly across the 
                    whole of Europe, as may be seen from the records, mainly of 
                    card games being banned. Little is known about the 
                    appearance and number of these cards, the only significant 
                    information being provided by a text by John of Rheinfelden 
                    in 1377 from Freiburg im Breisgau, who, in addition to other 
                    versions, describes the basic pack as containing the still-
                    current 4 suits of 13 cards, the courts usually being the 
                    King, Ober and Unter ("marshals"), although Dames and Queens 
                    were already known by then.

                    An early pattern of playing cards used the suits of batons 
                    or clubs, coins, swords, and cups. These suits are still 
                    used in traditional Italian, Spanish and Portuguese playing 
                    card decks, and are also used in modern (occult) tarot 
                    divination cards that first appeared in the late 18th 
                    century.A lost tarot-like pack was commissioned by Duke 
                    Filippo Maria Visconti and described by Martiano da Tortona, 
                    probably between 1418 and 1425 since the painter he 
                    mentions, Michelino da Besozzo, returned to Milan in 1418, 
                    while Martiano himself died in 1425. He described a 60-card 
                    deck with 16 cards having images of the Roman gods and suits 
                    depicting four kinds of birds. The 16 cards were regarded as 
                    "trumps" since, in 1449, Jacopo Antonio Marcello recalled 
                    that the now deceased duke had invented a novum quoddam et 
                    exquisitum triumphorum genus, or "a new and exquisite kind 
                    of triumphs." Other early decks that also showcased 
                    classical motifs include the Sola-Busca and Boiardo-Viti 
                    decks of the 1490s.

                        Like the common playing cards, tarot has four suits that 
                        vary by region: French suits are used in western, 
                        central and eastern Europe, and Latin suits in southern 
                        Europe.

                    <h3 id="suits">Suits</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each suit has 14 cards: ten pip cards numbering from one 
                        (or Ace) to ten; and four face cards: King, Queen, 
                        Knight, and Jack/Knave/Page. In addition, and unlike 
                        standard packs, the tarot also has a separate 21-card 
                        trump suit and a single card known as the Fool. 
                        Depending on the game, the Fool may act as the top trump 
                        or may be played to avoid following suit. These tarot 
                        cards are still used throughout much of Europe to play 
                        conventional card games.
