                        Tarot (/ˈtæroʊ/, first known as trionfi and later as 
                        tarocchi or tarocks) is a pack of playing cards, used 
                        from at least the mid-15th century in various parts of 
                        Europe to play card games such as Tarocchini. From their 
                        Italian roots, tarot-playing cards spread to most of 
                        Europe, evolving into a family of games that includes 
                        German Grosstarok and modern games such as French Tarot 
                        and Austrian Königrufen. In the late 18th century French 
                        occultists made elaborate, but unsubstantiated, claims 
                        about their history and meaning, leading to the 
                        emergence of custom decks for use in divination via 
                        tarot card reading and cartomancy. Thus, there are two 
                        distinct types of tarot packs in circulation: those used 
                        for card games and those used for divination. However, 
                        some older patterns, such as the Tarot de Marseille, 
                        originally intended for playing card games, are also 
                        used for cartomancy.

                    Like the common playing cards, tarot has four suits that 
                    vary by region: French suits are used in western, central 
                    and eastern Europe, and Latin suits in southern Europe.

                <p>
                    Each suit has 14 cards: ten pip cards numbering from one (or 
                    Ace) to ten; and four face cards: King, Queen, Knight, and 
                    Jack/Knave/Page. In addition, and unlike standard packs, the 
                    tarot also has a separate 21-card trump suit and a single 
                    card known as the Fool. Depending on the game, the Fool may 
                    act as the top trump or may be played to avoid following 
                    suit. These tarot cards are still used throughout much of 
                    Europe to play conventional card games

                    The use of tarot playing cards was at one time widespread 
                    across the whole of Europe except the British Isles and the 
                    Iberian Peninsula.[citation needed] Having fallen into 
                    decline by the 20th century, they later experienced a 
                    renaissance in some countries and regions. For example, 
                    French Tarot was largely confined to Provence in the 18th 
                    century, but took off in the 1950s to such an extent that, 
                    in 1973, the French Tarot Association (Fédération Française 
                    de Tarot) was formed and French Tarot itself is now the 
                    second most popular card game in France. Tarock games 
                    like Königrufen have experienced significant growth in 
                    Austria where international tournaments are held with other 
                    nations, especially those from eastern Europe that still 
                    play such games, including Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and 
                    Slovenia. Denmark appears to be the only Scandinavian 
                    country that still plays tarot games, Danish Tarok being 
                    a derivative of historical German Grosstarock. The game of 
                    Cego has grown in popularity again in the south German 
                    region of Baden. Italy continues to play regionally 
                    popular games with their distinctive Tarot packs. These 
                    include: Ottocento in Bologna and Sicilian Tarocchi in 
                    parts of Sicily. Meanwhile Troccas and Troggu are still 
                    played locally in parts of Switzerland.

                    Tarot cards, then known as tarocchi, first appeared in 
                    Ferrara and Milan in northern Italy, with the Fool and 21 
                    trumps (then called trionfi) being added to the standard 
                    Italian pack of four suits: batons, coins, cups and swords. 
                    Scholarship has established that the early European cards 
                    were probably based on the Egyptian Mamluk deck invented in 
                    or before the 14th century, which followed the introduction 
                    of paper from Asia into Western Europe. By the late 
                    1300s, Europeans were producing their own cards, the 
                    earliest patterns being based on the Mamluk deck but with 
                    variations to the suit symbols and court cards.
                    The first records of playing cards in Europe date to 1367 in 
                    Bern and they appear to have spread very rapidly across the 
                    whole of Europe, as may be seen from the records, mainly of 
                    card games being banned. Little is known about the 
                    appearance and number of these cards, the only significant 
                    information being provided by a text by John of Rheinfelden 
                    in 1377 from Freiburg im Breisgau, who, in addition to other 
                    versions, describes the basic pack as containing the still-
                    current 4 suits of 13 cards, the courts usually being the 
                    King, Ober and Unter ("marshals"), although Dames and Queens 
                    were already known by then.
                    An early pattern of playing cards used the suits of batons 
                    or clubs, coins, swords, and cups. These suits are still 
                    used in traditional Italian, Spanish and Portuguese playing 
                    card decks, and are also used in modern (occult) tarot 
                    divination cards that first appeared in the late 18th 
                    century.A lost tarot-like pack was commissioned by Duke 
                    Filippo Maria Visconti and described by Martiano da Tortona, 
                    probably between 1418 and 1425 since the painter he 
                    mentions, Michelino da Besozzo, returned to Milan in 1418, 
                    while Martiano himself died in 1425. He described a 60-card 
                    deck with 16 cards having images of the Roman gods and suits 
                    depicting four kinds of birds. The 16 cards were regarded as 
                    "trumps" since, in 1449, Jacopo Antonio Marcello recalled 
                    that the now deceased duke had invented a novum quoddam et 
                    exquisitum triumphorum genus, or "a new and exquisite kind 
                    of triumphs." Other early decks that also showcased 
                    classical motifs include the Sola-Busca and Boiardo-Viti 
                    decks of the 1490s.

                    The first documented tarot decks were recorded between 1440 
                    and 1450 in Milan, Ferrara, Florence and Bologna, when 
                    additional trump cards with allegorical illustrations were 
                    added to the common four-suit pack. These new decks were 
                    called carte da trionfi, triumph cards, and the additional 
                    cards known simply as trionfi, which became "trumps" in 
                    English. The earliest documentation of trionfi is found in a 
                    written statement in the court records of Florence, in 1440, 
                    regarding the transfer of two decks to Sigismondo Pandolfo 
                    Malatesta. The oldest surviving tarot cards are the 15 or so 
                    decks of the Visconti-Sforza Tarot painted in the mid-15th 
                    century for the rulers of the Duchy of Milan. In 15th 
                    century Italy, the set of cards that was included in tarot 
                    packs, including trumps, seems to have been consistent, even 
                    if naming and ordering varied. There are two main 
                    exceptions: Some late 15th century decks like the Sola Busca 
                    tarot and the Boiardo deck had four suits, a fool, and 21 
                    trumps, but none of the trumps match tarot ones. They seem 
                    to have been made on the model of tarot decks, but were 
                    voluntary departures from an established standard. The 
                    Visconti di Mondrone pack, one of the Visconti-Sforza decks, 
                    originally had a Dame and a Maid in each suit, in addition 
                    to the standard King, Queen, Knight, and Jack. Additionally, 
                    the pack includes three trump cards which represent the 
                    theological virtues of Faith, Hope, and Charity, and are not 
                    present in any other tarot deck of that era. Although a 
                    Dominican preacher inveighed against the evil inherent in 
                    playing cards, chiefly because of their use in gambling, in 
                    a sermon in the 15th century, no routine condemnations 
                    of tarot were found during its early history.

                <p>
                    Because the earliest tarot cards were hand-painted, the 
                    number of the decks produced is thought to have been small. 
                    It was only after the invention of the printing press that 
                    mass production of cards became possible. The expansion of 
                    tarot outside of Italy, first to France and Switzerland, 
                    occurred during the Italian Wars. The most prominent tarot 
                    deck version used in these two countries was the Tarot of 
                    Marseilles, of Milanese origin. While the set of trumps was 
                    generally consistent, their order varied by region, perhaps 
                    as early as the 1440s. Michael Dummett placed them into 
                    three categories. In Bologna and Florence, the highest trump 
                    is the Angel, followed by the World. This group spread 
                    mainly southward through the Papal States, the Kingdom of 
                    Naples, and finally down to the Kingdom of Sicily but was 
                    also known in the Savoyard states. In Ferrara, the World was 
                    the highest, followed by Justice and the Angel. This group 
                    spread mainly to the northeast to Venice and Trento where it 
                    was only a passing fad. By the end of the 16th century, this 
                    order became extinct. In Milan, the World was highest, 
                    followed by the Angel; this ordering is used in the Tarot of 
                    Marseilles. Dummett also wrote about a possible fourth 
                    lineage that may have existed along the Franco-Italian 
                    border. It spread north through France until its last 
                    descendant, the Belgian Tarot, went extinct around 1800. In 
                    Florence, an expanded deck called Minchiate was later used. 
                    This deck of 97 cards includes astrological symbols and the 
                    four elements, as well as traditional tarot motifs. The 
                    earliest known mention of this game, under the name of 
                    germini, dates to 1506.

                <h4 id="etym">Etymology</h4>
                <p>
                    The word "tarot" and German Tarock derive from the 
                    Italian Tarocchi, the origin of which is uncertain, although 
                    taroch was used as a synonym for foolishness in the late 
                    15th and early 16th centuries. The decks were known 
                    exclusively as Trionfi during the fifteenth century. The new 
                    name first appeared in Brescia around 1502 as Tarocho. 
                    During the 16th century, a new game played with a standard 
                    deck but sharing a very similar name (Trionfa) was quickly 
                    becoming popular. This coincided with the older game being 
                    renamed tarocchi. In modern Italian, the singular term is 
                    Tarocco, which, as a noun, is a cultivar of blood orange. 
                    The attribute Tarocco and the verb Taroccare are used 
                    regionally to indicate that something is fake or forged. 
                    This meaning is directly derived from the tarocchi game as 
                    played in Italy, in which tarocco indicates a card that can 
                    be played in place of another card.
