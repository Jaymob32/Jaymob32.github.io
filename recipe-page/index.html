        <h3>Cook Chicken</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, mix olive oil, Italian seasoning, lemon pepper, 
                smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Rub this 
                mixture all over the chicken breasts.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Heat a large pan over medium-high heat and cook the chicken for 
                about 5-7 minutes per side, until golden and fully cooked 
                through.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Remove the chicken from the pan, let it cool, then slice it into 
                bite-sized pieces.
            </li>
            <h3>Cook Pasta</h3>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Cook your favorite pasta according to the package instructions 
                for al dente (usually around 8-10 minutes), then drain and set 
                aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <h3>Make Alfredo Sauce</h3>
            <li>
                In the same pan, melt butter over medium heat.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add minced garlic and cook for about 1-2 minutes, until 
                fragrant.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Slowly pour in the heavy cream, then stir in Italian seasoning, 
                salt, pepper, and a dash of nutmeg.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for about 3-5 minutes, then 
                whisk in parmesan cheese and cream cheese.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Continue cooking and stirring until thickened but smooth and 
                creamy.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Once the cheese is melted, fold in fresh parsley.
            </li>
            <h3>Assembly & Baking</h3>
            <li>
                Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In your baking dish, combine the cooked pasta, sliced chicken, 
                and Alfredo sauce until everything is evenly coated.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Top with shredded mozzarella cheese. Add a bit more chicken on 
                top if you want.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake for 10-15 minutes, until the cheese is melted and slightly 
                golden.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Switch the oven to broil and broil for 2-3 minutes until the top 
                is bubbly and golden brown.
            </li>
